    "To combat this, and as it might lead to a few other benefits, this notebook attempts to make an agent manually.\n",

    "NOTE: Its possible that the best way to do this would be to make both the robot and the operator its own agent. Obviously some hard-coded guidance will be needed, but this might make it easier for the two to communicate over text.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is not functional, another option would be to use a language model as a translation layer. The agent can answer through text, and another language model can translate that to something code can understand."
