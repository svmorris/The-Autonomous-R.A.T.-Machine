    "\n",
    "It is clear from previous testing, that even on very simple challenges, its not enough to simply point the agent at a target and tell it to hack it. When tried with even simplest of websites, the agent got confused, crashed and only really got the answer about 10% of the time.\n",

    "This will clearly not work for more complex, real world tasks.\n",

    "The goal for this file is to try make an agent that is guided more closely towards achieving its goal."
