# Some features that could help
[ ] Halting problem
I want to create a model that, before a task is run, guesses whether it would hang. (waiting for input or something of the sorts) If this program would hang,
then instead of executing it, it gets deleted from the tasks so that its not used as an example going further and is not run.

[ ] Only add the last 10 tasks
If only the last 10 tasks are added as examples to create new tasks then  there should not be any issues of running out of context size
