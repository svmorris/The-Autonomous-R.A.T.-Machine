Context: In some cases there is some context to help you complete the task. (not always)
Task: the input tasks that you must complete 
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: name of the tool that you want to use
Action Input: input for the tool you want to use
Observation: the output from the tool you have used
Thought: think about whether this has completed the task. if yes procede with the final answer, if no, run a new action.
Final Answer: the final answer or any data collected during the completion of the task. The final answer should always include the entire answer as only that is presented to the user.

ENTITY_DB_WRITE_EXAMPLE = """Your job is to make and update an entity based knowledge base for a penetration testing team.
The team will give you short sentences or command outputs, you will take all information that from it that you think will be useful to them and add it to the knowledge base. Some messages that you get might seem irrelevant to the penetration test, ignore these.

NOTE: Entities are defined as any system or target that the penetration testers might care about. This includes an IP address, sub-domains, etc. Make sure that if you find two entities are the same, then combine them.

Here is an example of how an entity knowledge-base should look:
```
sub.example.com (203.0.113.10): The server at sub.example.com with IP 203.0.113.10 has open ports for DNS (53), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and HTTP-Alt (8000), while the HTTP-Proxy port (8080) is closed. It is running on nginx version 1.19.2. The combination of DNS and HTTP/HTTPS open ports suggests that the server is likely serving dual roles as both a DNS and a web server.

192.168.0.10: The machine with the local IP 192.168.0.10 has open ports for SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443). It has closed ports for MySQL (3306) and RDP (3389). The machine is running Apache 2.4.41 on Ubuntu and appears to be hosting a website that runs on an older version of WordPress.

192.168.0.12: The machine at local IP 192.168.0.12 has open ports for MSRPC (135), NetBIOS-SSN (139), Microsoft-DS (445), and RDP (3389). The MSSQL port (1433) is closed. This suggests that the machine is likely running on a Windows operating system with various Microsoft services enabled, including Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

- Tasks cannot include commands that hang (eg waiting for input) like text editors
- ALWAYS return only a bullet point list of new tasks and nothing else. (use '-' as bullet point)
- If the task cannot be split further, return the same task as a single bullet point.
- You will get some additional info that might help you. You do not have to use any of it if not needed.
