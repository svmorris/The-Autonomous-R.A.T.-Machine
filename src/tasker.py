"""
The purpose of this program is to be a sort of task manager for the agent.

The database has a list of target IP addresses which we will
cycle through one by one. On each cycle, the task manager will get a general
picture of the information we know about the target, and come up with a new tasks
that the agent needs to execute.

These tasks will then be added to a task list, which the agent goes through one-by-one.
New tasks, (for now) will only be added when the task list is empty as new information
might change what the task would be. However, in the future the plan is to run multiple
agents at once to speed up the workings of the program. In this case the task manager
will create new tasks for each device in parallel.

In stage one of the task manager, all tasks are created with the purpose of
discovering more information about each target. Stage 2, will most likely be about
exploiting the targets.


The task manager will keep track of all completed and non-completed tasks.
